The SDL port to the Atari Jaguar

todo:
add console specific features and optimizations
gamepad support
mouse/keyboard emulation support
audio support
CD support

to build the library with Makefile.ajaguar:
make -f Makefile.ajaguar

to build the tests with Makefile.ajaguar
make -f Makefile.ajaguar test

using the libraries, and/or the tests, require additional works specific to the platform

Improvements and fixes are welcome.
